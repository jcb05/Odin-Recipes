<body><h2><strong>Description</strong></h2>
    <p>Key lime pie offers a delightful blend of tangy citrus and sweet creaminess, making it a beloved dessert choice. Begin by preparing the graham cracker crust, combining crushed graham crackers with melted butter and a touch of sugar. Press this mixture firmly into a pie dish to form a solid base for the pie. For the filling, whisk together sweetened condensed milk, freshly squeezed key lime juice, and lime zest until well combined and slightly thickened. Pour this luscious mixture into the prepared crust and bake until set. After cooling to room temperature, chill the pie in the refrigerator for several hours to enhance its creamy texture. Serve each slice garnished with a dollop of whipped cream and a sprinkle of lime zest, inviting your taste buds to revel in the perfect balance of tartness and sweetness that defines this classic dessert.</p>

    <h2><strong>Ingredients</strong></h2>

        <p><strong>For the filling:</strong>
        1 can (14 ounces) sweetened condensed milk
        4 large egg yolks
        1/2 cup freshly squeezed key lime juice (regular lime juice can be substituted if key limes are not available)
        1 tablespoon grated lime zest</p>

        <p><strong>garnish (optional):</strong>
        Whipped cream
        Lime slices or zest
        These ingredients come together to create a creamy, tangy filling nestled in a crisp graham cracker crust, perfect for a refreshing dessert on a warm day. Adjustments can be made based on personal preference and availability of ingredients.</p></ul>

    <h2><strong>Steps</strong></h2>
    <ol>
        <p><strong>Prepare the Crust:</strong>
        Preheat your oven to 350F (175C).
        In a bowl, combine the graham cracker crumbs, granulated sugar, and melted butter until the mixture resembles wet sand.
        Press the mixture firmly and evenly into the bottom and up the sides of a 9-inch pie dish.
        Bake the crust in the preheated oven for about 10 minutes, or until lightly golden and set. Remove from the oven and set aside to cool while preparing the filling.</p>
       
        <p><strong>Make the Filling:</strong> 
        In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the sweetened condensed milk, egg yolks, freshly squeezed key lime juice, and grated lime zest until smooth and well combined.
        Pour the filling mixture into the cooled graham cracker crust, spreading it evenly with a spatula.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Bake the Pie:</strong>
        Return the pie to the oven and bake at 350F (175C) for 15-18 minutes, or until the filling is set and the edges are just beginning to brown. The center of the pie should still jiggle slightly when gently shaken.
        Remove the pie from the oven and let it cool to room temperature on a wire rack. Once cooled, refrigerate the pie for at least 2 hours (or preferably overnight) to allow it to set completely.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Serve and Garnish:</strong>
        Before serving, optionally garnish the pie with whipped cream and additional lime zest or slices.
        Slice and serve chilled, enjoying each refreshing bite of this classic key lime pie.
        This dessert captures the essence of summer with its vibrant citrus flavor and creamy texture, making it a delightful treat for any occasion.</p></ol>
