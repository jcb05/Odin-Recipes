    <h2><strong>Description</strong></h2>
    <p>Key lime pie offers a delightful blend of tangy citrus and sweet creaminess, making it a beloved dessert choice. Begin by preparing the graham cracker crust, combining crushed graham crackers with melted butter and a touch of sugar. Press this mixture firmly into a pie dish to form a solid base for the pie. For the filling, whisk together sweetened condensed milk, freshly squeezed key lime juice, and lime zest until well combined and slightly thickened. Pour this luscious mixture into the prepared crust and bake until set. After cooling to room temperature, chill the pie in the refrigerator for several hours to enhance its creamy texture. Serve each slice garnished with a dollop of whipped cream and a sprinkle of lime zest, inviting your taste buds to revel in the perfect balance of tartness and sweetness that defines this classic dessert.</p>
